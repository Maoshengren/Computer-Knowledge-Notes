- This repository is my daily notes about computer knowledge, includes OS, Data Structure, Computer Networking, and so on. 
- In case of my computer breakdown, I back up these notes on Github.
- Some of them Iâ€™ve not studied, So the contents are empty.

- The early notes I took used Chinese, and now I begin to read the professional book in English, so I use English to take notes.
