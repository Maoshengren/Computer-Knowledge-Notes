## 2.Introduction to the Relational Model

### 2.1 Structure of Relational Databases

>A relational database consists of a collection of **tables**, each of which is assigned a unique name. 

- Consider the *instructor* table of Figure 2.1, which stores information about instructors. 
  - The table has four column headers: ID, name, dept_name, and salary. 
  - Each row of this table records information about an instructor.
  - Note that each instructor is identified by the value of the column ID

- In general, a row in a table represents a ***relationship*** among a set of values.

- In mathematical terminology, a tuple is simply a sequence (or list) of values. 
- A relationship between n values is represented mathematically by an n-tuple of values,  a tuple with n values, which corresponds to a row in a table.
- Thus, in the relational model the term **relation** is used to refer to a **table**, while the term **tuple** is used to refer to a **row**. 
- Similarly, the term **attribute** refers to a **column** of a table.

- We use the term **relation instance** to refer to a specific instance of a relation containing a specific set of rows.

- In this chapter, we shall be using a number of different relations to illustrate the various concepts underlying the relational data model. These relations represent part of a university. 

- The order in which tuples appear in a relation is irrelevant, since a relation is a set of tuples. Thus, whether the tuples of a relation are listed in sorted order, or are unsorted,  does not matter.
  - For ease of exposition, we will mostly show the relations sorted by their first attribute.

- For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of ***permitted values***, called the **domain** of that attribute. 

- We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be **atomic**. 
  - A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be ***indivisible units***. 

- The **null** value is a special value that signifies that the value is unknown or does not exist.

### 2.2 Database Schema

> When we talk about a database, we must differentiate between the **database schema**, which is the logical design of the database, and the **database instance**, which is a **snapshot** of the data in the database at a given instant in time.
>
> The concept of a relation corresponds to the programming-language notion of a variable, while the concept of a relation schema corresponds to the programming-language notion of type definition.

- In general, a relation schema consists of a list of attributes and their corresponding domains.
  - The concept of a relation instance corresponds to the programming-language notion of a value of a variable. 
  - The value of a given variable may change with time; similarly the contents of a relation instance may change with time as the relation is updated. 
  -  In contrast, the schema of a relation does not generally change.

- Consider the department relation of Figure 2.5. The schema for that relation is
  `department (dept_name, building, budget)`

- Note that the attribute dept_name appears in both the instructor schema and the department schema. 

  Using common attributes in relation schemas is one way of relating tuples of distinct relations.

- Each course in a university may be offered multiple times, across different semesters, or even within a semester. We need a relation to describe each individual offering, or section, of the class. The schema is

  `section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_number, time_slot_id)`

- We need a relation to describe the association between instructors and the class sections that they teach. The relation schema to describe this association is

  `teaches (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)`
