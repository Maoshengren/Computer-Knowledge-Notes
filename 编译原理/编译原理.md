### 2.2 Syntax Definition

> we introduce a notation — the "context-free grammar," or "grammar" for short, that is used to specify the syntax of a language. 

- A grammar naturally describes the hierarchical structure of most programming language constructs. 

**Definition of Grammars**

- A context-free grammar has four components:
  1. A set of ***terminal*** symbols, sometimes referred to as "tokens."
  2. A set of ***nonterminals***, sometimes called "syntactic variables." 
  3. A set of ***productions***, where each production consists of a nonterminal, called the head or left side of the production, an arrow, and a sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals, called the body or right side of the produc­tion. 
  4. A designation of one of the nonterminals as the start symbol.
- Since a plus or minus sign must appear between two digits, we refer to such expressions as "lists of digits separated by plus or minus signs." The following grammar describes the syntax of these expressions. The productions are:

**Derivations**

>A grammar derives strings by beginning with the start symbol and repeatedly replacing a nonterminal by the body of a production for that nonterminal. 

- A somewhat different sort of list is the list of parameters in a function call. like `max(x, y)`

- We may start to develop a grammar for such sequences with the productions:

- Note that the second possible body for ***optpamms*** ("optional parameter list") is $\epsilon$, which stands for the empty string of symbols. 

***

**Parse Trees**

>A parse tree pictorially shows how the start symbol of a grammar derives a string in the language. 

- Formally, given a context-free grammar, a parse tree according to the grammar is a tree with the following properties:
  - The root is labeled by the start symbol.
  - Each leaf is labeled by a terminal or by $\epsilon$.
  - Each interior node is labeled by a nonterminal.

**Ambiguity**

>A grammar can have more than one parse tree generating a given string of terminals. Such a grammar is said to be ambiguous. 

**Associativity of Operators**

>We say that the operator + ***associates*** to the left, because an operand with plus signs on both sides of it belongs to the operator to its left. 
>
>In most programming languages the four arithmetic operators, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are ***left-associative***.
>
>The assignment operator = in C and its descendants is right­ associative; that is, the expression a=b=c is treated in the some way as the expression a= (b=c).

- The parse tree for 9-5-2 grows down towards the left, whereas the parse tree for a=b=c grows down towards the right.

**Precedence of Operators**

>We say that * has higher precedence than + if * takes its operands before + does.
