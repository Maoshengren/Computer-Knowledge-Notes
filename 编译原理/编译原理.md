# Compilers Princeple

## 1. Introduction

### 1.2 The structure of a compiler

> analysis and synthesis.

- The *analysis part* breaks up the source program into constituent pieces and imposes a grammatical structure on them.
  - The analysis part also collects information about the source program and stores it in a data structure called a **symbol table**, which is passed along with the intermediate representation to the synthesis part.

- The *synthesis part* constructs the desired target program from the interme­diate representation and the information in the symbol table. 

>If we examine the compilation process in more detail, we see that it operates as a sequence of **phases**, each of which transforms one representation of the source program to another. 
>
>The symbol table, which stores information about the entire source program, is used by all phases of the compiler.

**Lexical Analysis**

>The first phase of a compiler is called lexical analysis or scanning. The lex­ical analyzer reads the stream of characters making up the source program and groups the characters into meaningful sequences called **lexemes**. 
>
>For each lexeme, the lexical analyzer produces as output a token of the form
>$$
><token-name, attribute-value>
>$$
>In the token, the first component token-name is an abstract symbol that is used during syntax analysis, and the second component attribute-value points to an entry in the symbol table for this token.

For example, suppose a source program contains the assignment statement
$position = initial + rate * 60$

- position is a lexeme that would be mapped into a token <id, 1>, where **id** is an abstract symbol standing for ***identifier*** and 1 points to the symbol­ table entry for position. 
  - The symbol-table entry for an identifier holds ***information*** about the identifier, such as its *name and type*.

- The assignment symbol = is a lexeme that is mapped into the token <=>. 
  - Since this token needs no attribute-value, we have omitted the second component. 
  - For notational convenience we have chosen to use the ***lexeme itself*** as the name of the abstract symbol.

- initial is a lexeme that is mapped into the token <id, 2>, where 2 points to the symbol-table entry for initial.

- 60 is a lexeme that is mapped into the token <60>.

After lexical analysis as the sequence of tokens
$<id, 1> <=> <id, 2> <+> <id, 3> <*> <60>$

**Syntax Analysis**

> The second phase of the compiler is syntax analysis or **parsing**. 

- The subsequent phases of the compiler use the grammatical structure to help analyze the source program and generate the target program. 

**Semantic Analysis**

>The semantic analyzer uses the syntax tree and the information in the symbol table to check the source program for semantic consistency with the language definition. 

- An important part of semantic analysis is type checking, where the compiler checks that each operator has matching operands. 

- The language specification may permit some type conversions called **coercions**. 

**Intermediate Code Generation**

>After syntax and semantic analysis of the source program, many compil­ers generate an explicit low-level or machine-like intermediate representation.
>
>This intermedi­ate representation should have two important properties: it should be easy to produce and it should be easy to translate into the target machine.

## 2. A Simple Syntax-Directed Translator

### 2.2 Syntax Definition

> we introduce a notation — the "context-free grammar," or "grammar" for short, that is used to specify the syntax of a language. 

- A grammar naturally describes the hierarchical structure of most programming language constructs. 

**Definition of Grammars**

- A context-free grammar has four components:
  1. A set of ***terminal*** symbols, sometimes referred to as "tokens."
  2. A set of ***nonterminals***, sometimes called "syntactic variables." 
  3. A set of ***productions***, where each production consists of a nonterminal, called the head or left side of the production, an arrow, and a sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals, called the body or right side of the produc­tion. 
  4. A **designation** of one of the nonterminals as the start symbol.
- Since a plus or minus sign must appear between two digits, we refer to such expressions as "lists of digits separated by plus or minus signs." The following grammar describes the syntax of these expressions. The productions are:

**Derivations**

>A grammar derives strings by beginning with the start symbol and repeatedly replacing a nonterminal by the body of a production for that nonterminal. 

- A somewhat different sort of list is the list of parameters in a function call. like `max(x, y)`

- We may start to develop a grammar for such sequences with the productions:

- Note that the second possible body for ***optpamms*** ("optional parameter list") is $\epsilon$, which stands for the empty string of symbols. 

***

**Parse Trees**

>A parse tree pictorially shows how the start symbol of a grammar derives a string in the language. 

- Formally, given a context-free grammar, a parse tree according to the grammar is a tree with the following properties:
  - The root is labeled by the start symbol.
  - Each leaf is labeled by a terminal or by $\epsilon$.
  - Each interior node is labeled by a nonterminal.

**Ambiguity**

>A grammar can have more than one parse tree generating a given string of terminals. Such a grammar is said to be ambiguous. 

**Associativity of Operators**

>We say that the operator + ***associates*** to the left, because an operand with plus signs on both sides of it belongs to the operator to its left. 
>
>In most programming languages the four arithmetic operators, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are ***left-associative***.
>
>The assignment operator = in C and its descendants is right­ associative; that is, the expression a=b=c is treated in the some way as the expression a= (b=c).

- The parse tree for 9-5-2 grows down towards the left, whereas the parse tree for a=b=c grows down towards the right.

**Precedence of Operators**

>We say that * has higher precedence than + if * takes its operands before + does.
